20.25=<color=default>[Ryan]: Okay, calm down, just tell me what the hell happened to you, brother.
23.7=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Don't worry, I'm fine, that's not important now, I will explain later.
29.5=<color=default>[Ryan]: Hey, look, just stay put and don't talk and move, I'll get you a medkit okay? Just wait here.

1.2=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Without you I could have been a goner...
4.0=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Well, I got to say: The situation in the facility is kind of complicated.
8.2=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: You see, the entire place went out.
11.5=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: In my opinion, the best option for you is to turn on the power.
15.0=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: I think there is a generator in a construction tunnels.
19.2=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: I wish you luck my friend, take care, all right?

[SFX\Player\Dialogue\line_9_1_player.ogg]

2.0=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Did you turn on the generator already?
5.0=<color=default>[Ryan]: Yeah, I did, did something change?
7.7=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: No, it seems that generator didn't give much power...
12.0=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Shit!
13.0=<color=default>[Ryan]: Oh, god damn it, what should I do then?
16.7=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Uumm, I think you must go the the facility reactor room.
20.9=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Good luck, man, cause I don't know what to expect from there.

[SFX\Player\Dialogue\line_10_1_player.ogg]
0.5=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Ah!

4.2=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: No-no-no-no-no, you don't need to explain, I know that reactor is malfunctioning.
8.1=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: You need to get topside.
9.6=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: Find Gate C Entrance, you must launch satellite rocket.
12.1=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: If you will do so, O5 will be able to remotely turn on power in the facility.
18.2=<color=vincent>[Vincent]: This is our last hope...
20.3=<color=default>[Ryan]: All right, I'll do it.

0.55=<color=janitor>[George]: Oh, hey Ryan!
3.1=<color=janitor>[George]: It's been a while.
5.1=<color=janitor>[George]: Ah, let me guess, you probably want to enter this Councill O5 office that's behind me?
11.7=<color=janitor>[George]: You know, I wanted to do it as well, because all of the gates are locked down, and there is no other escape from the facility.
20.4=<color=janitor>[George]: It's dangerous here, and everybody wants to live.
24.0=<color=janitor>[George]: But, the main problem is that this door requires a password which I don't know, and without a password I can't open it.
32.9=<color=janitor>[George]: And without this I can not open the gates!
36.3=<color=janitor>[George]: This is so bad. I don't know what to do really...
41.5=<color=janitor>[George]: One person told me, that this password may lay inside of SCP-076 areas, but...
47.6=<color=janitor>[George]: I can not prove it.
49.9=<color=janitor>[George]: I have never been there. And I really do not want to go there.
55.1=<color=janitor>[George]: What if <color=red>Abel<color=janitor> has breached his containment, and on his way to destroy everyone?
61.9=<color=janitor>[George]: I really do not want to risk my life for something stupid, like a fricken password note!
69.4=<color=janitor>[George]: Oh...
70.6=<color=janitor>[George]: I really do not know what to do at this point...
74.3=<color=janitor>[George]: If you have will and time to go to the Reinforced Containment Zone, you can check it and...
83.6=<color=janitor>[George]: If <color=red>Abel<color=janitor> is there, please make sure to get rid oh him, because that would be a disaster if he escaped...
93.3=<color=janitor>[George]: Oh, anyway, I will have to think about something on my own...

101.3=<color=janitor>[George]: Please.

0.6=To everyone still inside the facility, stay in the evacuation shelters. Do not try to make it to the exits, no matter how close they are. The shelters are your best chance of making it through this.

[SFX\Radio\Franklin3.ogg]
0.635=To everyone still hearing this, reality-bending events are common during containment breaches of this magnitude. Do not trust your senses! Do not trust anyone or anything.

11.3=Nothing at all will help.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio3.ogg]

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio4.ogg]
3.5=Should you hear a different voice announcing for SCP foundation on-site radio, disregard it entirely. He is not a foundation employee. He is trying to trick you and cannot be trusted. Any advice he gives can only inevitably lead to destruction, death, and utter chaos. You are immeasurably better off listening to me.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio5.ogg]
3.8=In the extremely unlikely event of a catastrophic power failure and subsequent facility-wide containment breach, just remember the crisis ABCs. A for armaments. B for blinking, come the lack of.

40.40=<glitch=true>Just listen to me.

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio7.ogg]

[SFX\Radio\SCPRadio8.ogg]
